# Week 1 – Basics & Simple Applications

## Day 2 (12 Feb) – Arrays (Dynamic Growth)

**Concept:** Dynamic arrays, resizing  
**Example Scenario:** Video streaming buffer  

### Exercise
- Implement an array that doubles in size when full  
- Add elements (simulated video packets) dynamically  

### Thinking Questions
- How to handle packets arriving out-of-order?  
- How to manage limited memory?  
- Could a linked list be used instead?  

---

## Day 3 (13 Feb, Fri) – Linked List (Basic)

**Concept:** Nodes, pointers, insertion, deletion  
**Example Scenario:** Music playlist manager  

### Exercise
- Create a linked list of songs  
- Add a song at the beginning/end  
- Delete a song  
- Display the playlist  

### Thinking Questions
- How to implement shuffle mode efficiently?  
- How to merge two playlists quickly?  
- Are there cache/memory issues compared to arrays?  

---

## Day 4 (16 Feb, Mon) – Linked List (System Constraints)

**Concept:** Memory usage, traversal time, pros/cons vs array  
**Example Scenario:** Browser tabs manager  

### Exercise
- Add, close, and display browser tabs using linked list  
- Search for a tab by name  

### Thinking Questions
- Searching 1000 tabs: Is linked list efficient?  
- Would arrays or trees be better?  
- How does memory fragmentation affect performance?  

---

## Day 5 (17 Feb) – HashMap (Basic)

**Concept:** Key-value mapping, fast lookup, collisions  
**Example Scenario:** User login system  

### Exercise
- Implement a HashMap with username → password  
- Add new users  
- Authenticate user login  

### Thinking Questions
- How to handle hash collisions?  
- How to support prefix search (e.g., "am*")?  
- Can this scale to millions of users?  

---

## Day 6–7 (18–19 Feb) – Mini Project: Chat App Backend

**Objective:** Combine arrays, linked lists, hashmap, queue, stack  

### Components
- Users → HashMap  
- Status → Array  
- Message history → LinkedList  
- Message queue → Queue  
- Undo → Stack  

### Exercise
- Add user registration and login  
- Send/receive messages  
- Undo last message using stack  

### Thinking Questions
- How to search messages efficiently?  
- How to scale for millions of users?  
- Should we replace linked lists with tree for history?  

---

# Week 2 – Applied Thinking & Assessment

## Day 8 (20 Feb, Fri) – Creativity Exercise

**Scenario:** Library Catalog  

### Exercise
- Use arrays, linked lists, or hashmap to store books  
- Add, remove, and search books  

### Thinking Questions
- Why choose one data structure over another?  
- How to handle thousands of books efficiently?  

---

## Day 9 (23 Feb, Mon) – Critical Thinking

**Scenario:** Shopping Cart System  

### Exercise
- Represent items in cart  
- Track discounts and wishlist  

### Thinking Questions
- Items = array or linked list?  
- Discounts = hashmap or list?  
- How to handle real-time updates?  

---

## Day 10 (24 Feb) – Collaboration Exercise

**Scenario:** URL Shortener  

### Exercise
- Map short URLs → original URLs using HashMap  
- Implement add new URL  
- Retrieve original URL  

### Thinking Questions
- How to handle millions of URLs?  
- How to work as a team on code integration?  

---

## Day 11 (25 Feb) – Coordination Challenge

**Scenario:** Task Scheduler  

### Exercise
- Use Queue / Priority Queue to schedule tasks  
- Execute tasks in order of priority  

### Thinking Questions
- How to coordinate team work?  
- How to manage task dependencies?  

---

## Day 12 (26 Feb) – Project Extension

**Scenario:** Chat App Enhancement  

### Exercise
- Implement search in message history  
- Add feature to scale for multiple users  

### Thinking Questions
- When to switch from linked list to tree/trie?  
- How to handle millions of messages?  

---

## Day 13 (27 Feb, Fri) – Assessment
